Facts: Home Builders III purchased substantially all of Home Builders II's assets. The purchase agreement contained no provision for assumption of any liabilities. Home Builders II had built several thousand defective homes. Home Builders III was made aware of this fact during negotiations even though no claims had been brought against Home Builders II at the time. Following the asset sale, Home Builders III maintained the same offices, employees, and management.

Facts: Mediocre Corp purchased all of Special Corp's assets. The purchase agreement provides for assumption of all of Special Corp's liabilities. Following","**Exceptions:** de facto merger, mere continuation  

**Explanation:**  
1. **De facto merger** applies because the directors of Small Chemical Corp assumed positions on Big Chemical Corp's board post-asset purchase, indicating a continuation of management and operational integration between the two entities. This blurs the distinction between the seller and purchaser, suggesting a functional merger.  

2. **Mere continuation** applies because the purchaser (Big Chemical Corp) is holding itself out as a continuation of the seller (Small Chemical Corp). This is evidenced by the directors' overlap and the implication that Big Chemical is operating as a continuation of Small Chemical, even though the legal entity may have changed.  

The other exceptions (express agreement and fraudulent conveyance) do not apply here. The purchase agreement explicitly limited liability to what was necessary for operations, not a full assumption of liabilities (so not *express agreement*). There is no indication of fraudulent intent or conveyance to avoid liability (*fraudulent conveyance*).","de facto merger,mere continuation",True,18827,676,36.33,0

1. the purchaser expressly agrees to be held liable (express agreement)

2. the assets are fraudulently conveyed to the purchaser in order to avoid liability (fraudulent conveyance)

3. there is a de facto merger between the purchaser and seller (de facto merger)

4. the purchaser is a mere continuation of the seller (mere continuation)

For the following fact patterns, determine which exceptions apply.

Facts: Big Chemical Corp purchased substantially all of Small Chemical Corp's assets three years ago. The purchase agreement included a provision that Big Chemical would assume Small Chemical's liabilities only to the extent necessary to continue its operations. Following the asset purhcase, Small Chemical's directors assumed directorships on Big Chemical's board. Residents of a town where Small Chemical had a factory now bring suit against Big Chemical for harm that occured several years prior to the asset purchase.

Text: the texas code does not define election laws, and we have found no case construing this phrase. thus, we first look to the ordinary, contemporary, common meaning of election laws. see perrin v. united states, 444 u.s. 37, 42, 100 s.ct. 311, 314, 62 l.ed.2d 199 (1979) (noting that it is a fundamental canon of statutory construction ... that, unless otherwise defined, words will be interpreted as taking their ordinary, contemporary, common meaning). we think that the common meaning of election laws is laws that specifically govern elections, rather than generally applicable laws that may affect elections. if the texas legislature wanted 31.003 to cover the latter, we doubt that it would have inserted the adjectival modifier election directly before the noun law. by forming an open compound phrase such as election law, the texas legislature meant a combination of separate words that are so closely related as to constitute a single concept. chicago manual of style 6.33 (14th rev. ed. 1993). an election district, for instance, is not a district devised for many functions, including elections; it is a district created for the purposes of elections. 5 oxford english dictionary 116 (2d ed. 1989). moreover, an election board is not an agency that carries out all the responsibilities of a municipality, including elections; it is an agency charged with the conduct of elections. blacks law dictionary 519 (6th ed.1990).

**Explanation**:  
- The mark ""Aswelly"" is an **invented word** with no prior meaning in English (it does not describe, suggest, or relate to taxis).  
- This matches the definition of a **fanciful** mark (e.g., ""Aswelly"" is not a real word, unlike ""Virgin"" in the arbitrary example).

  - ❌ **Generic**: Not a common name for taxis (e.g., ""Taxi"" itself would be generic).

  - ❌ **Suggestive**: Does not hint at a quality (e.g., ""SmoothRide"" would be suggestive).  
  - ❌ **Arbitrary**: Requires a real English word with no relation (e.g., ""Virgin"" for telecoms), but ""Aswelly"" is not a real word.

**Reasoning:**  
The sentence references a statutory provision (""36 Stat. 574"") and mentions a ""House committee report explaining"" (without providing the actual explanation or definition). It does not define a term—it merely cites a legal provision and refers to an external explanation. This matches the pattern of the ""No"" examples (e.g., ""See, e.g., Cal. Penal Code Ann. §1170"" or ""Pursuing this end, the Act set a minimum sales price...""), where the focus is on citing law or referencing a report without offering a definition.  

**Key distinction:**  
- **""Yes"" examples** explicitly provide a definition (e.g., ""Webster's defines 'threat' as..."") with a citation.  
- **""No"" examples** cite statutes, reports, or discuss legal arguments without defining a term.

Facts: Mediocre Corp purchased all of Special Corp's assets. The purchase agreement provides for assumption of all of Special Corp's liabilities. Following","Based on the fact pattern provided, the **only applicable exception is express agreement**. Here's the breakdown:

### Analysis of the Facts:
- **""Mediocre Corp purchased all of Special Corp's assets. The purchase agreement provides for assumption of all of Special Corp's liabilities.""**  
  → This directly satisfies **Exception #1: express agreement** (the purchaser expressly agreed to assume liabilities).  
  → *No other exceptions apply*:  
  - **Fraudulent conveyance (Exception #2)**: No indication the assets were sold to evade debt (e.g., no evidence of intent to defraud creditors).  
  - **De facto merger (Exception #3)**: No evidence of a merger (e.g., no consolidation of entities, shared management, or operational integration beyond the asset sale).  
  - **Mere continuation (Exception #4)**: Mediocre Corp ""holds itself out as Special Corp"" but *dissolved Special Corp* and operates as a distinct entity. Mere continuation requires the purchaser to be a ""continuation"" of the seller (e.g., same name, management, and operations *without* dissolution of the seller). Here, Special Corp dissolved, so this is **not** mere continuation.  

### Why the Other Exceptions Do *Not* Apply:
| Exception              | Why It Doesn’t Apply                                                                 |
|------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Fraudulent conveyance  | No evidence the sale was fraudulent (e.g., seller insolvent, buyer knew of fraud). |
| De facto merger        | No merger occurred (e.g., no joint board, shared facilities, or continuity of operations). |
| Mere continuation      | Special Corp dissolved *after* the sale. Mere continuation requires the seller to *continue* as a corporate entity (e.g., unchanged name/management). Here, Mediocre Corp *replaced* Special Corp. |

Facts: Mediocre Corp purchased all of Special Corp's assets. The purchase agreement provides for assumption of all of Special Corp's liabilities. Following","Based on the fact pattern provided, the applicable exceptions are **de facto merger** and **mere continuation**. Here's the analysis:

### Key Facts from the Case:
- **Asset Purchase**: Big Chemical Corp purchased *substantially all* of Small Chemical Corp's assets three years ago.
- **Purchase Agreement**: Limited liability assumption (""only to the extent necessary to continue operations"" – **not** a broad assumption of all liabilities).
- **Post-Purchase Integration**: Small Chemical's directors assumed directorships on Big Chemical's board.
- **Liability in Question**: Harm occurred **several years *prior* to the asset purchase** (pre-existing debt).

### Why the Exceptions Apply:
1. **De Facto Merger** (Exception #3):  
   - A de facto merger occurs when the purchaser and seller operate as a single entity after the sale, with the purchaser continuing the seller's business in a way that makes the transaction a ""merger"" in substance.  
   - **Here**: Small Chemical's directors joined Big Chemical's board *immediately after the sale*. This demonstrates a seamless continuity of management and control, signaling that Big Chemical was acting as a continuation of Small Chemical (not a separate entity).  
   - **Result**: Big Chemical is liable for Small Chemical's pre-sale liabilities (like the factory harm) under de facto merger principles.

2. **Mere Continuation** (Exception #4):  
   - Mere continuation applies when the purchaser is a ""continuation"" of the seller (e.g., same management, employees, business operations, and identity).  
   - **Here**: The fact that Small Chemical's directors became Big Chemical's directors is **classic evidence** of mere continuation. The buyer (Big Chemical) effectively became","de facto merger,mere continuation",True,36343,1024,28.91,0

Ava is from Alaska. Mia is from Missouri. Ava sues Mia for wrongful eviction for $61,000.

Answer:","The legal case between Ava (from Alaska) and Mia (from Missouri) involves a wrongful eviction claim for $61,000. 

**Analysis:**
- **Diversity of Citizenship:** Ava is an Alaskan citizen, and Mia is a Missourian citizen, satisfying the diversity requirement as they are from different states.
- **Amount in Controversy:** The claim is $61,000, which is below the federal jurisdiction threshold of $75,000.
- **Jurisdictional Implications:** Since the amount does not meet the threshold and there are no other exceptions (like a corporation being involved), federal diversity jurisdiction does not apply.

**Conclusion:**
The case would likely be heard in state court because the claim is under the required amount for federal diversity jurisdiction.",No,True,22203,786,36.72,687

Answer:","The lawsuit between Isabella from Alaska and Elijah from Montana for patent infringement with damages claimed at $1,522,000 falls under diversity jurisdiction in the United States federal courts. 

**Reasoning:**
- **Diversity of Citizenship:** Both parties are citizens of different states (Alaska and Montana), satisfying the diversity requirement.
- **Amount in Controversy:** The claim exceeds the federal jurisdiction threshold, which as of recent updates (post-2018) is significantly lower than $1,522,000, ensuring the case meets the monetary requirement for federal court.

The primary exception applicable in this scenario is ""express agreement."" The purchase agreement explicitly states that Mediocre Corp assumes all of Special Corp's liabilities. This clear contractual term overrides any other considerations regarding the continuity or identity of the business after the sale.

While it might be tempting to consider ""mere continuation"" due to Mediocre holding itself out as Special Corp, the express agreement in the contract is sufficient to establish liability without needing to invoke additional exceptions. Therefore, the most straightforward and applicable exception is the express assumption of liabilities.",express agreement,True,27936,970,36.31,1138

Facts: Mediocre Corp purchased all of Special Corp's assets. The purchase agreement provides for assumption of all of Special Corp's liabilities. Following","The exceptions that apply in this scenario are:

**Mere Continuation**

Explanation:
- **No Express Agreement**: The purchase agreement did not include any provisions for assuming liabilities, so express agreement does not apply.
- **No Fraudulent Conveyance**: There is no indication that the sale was intended to defraud creditors, as there were no active claims at the time of the sale.
- **Mere Continuation**: HomeBuilders III maintained the same offices, employees, and management structure, suggesting they continued the business operations without significant changes, which fits the mere continuation exception.

The de facto merger exception is not applicable here because the facts do not indicate that HomeBuilders II ceased to exist or that there was a formal or informal absorption of one entity by the other. The focus on maintaining the same structure leans more towards mere continuation rather than a merger.","mere continuation,fraudulent conveyance",True,26577,927,36.22,941

Ava is from Alaska. Mia is from Missouri. Ava sues Mia for wrongful eviction for $61,000.

Answer:","To determine the appropriate jurisdiction and applicable laws for Ava's lawsuit against Mia for wrongful eviction, we need to consider several factors:

1. **Jurisdiction**: Since Ava is from Alaska and Mia is from Missouri, the choice of jurisdiction will depend on where the alleged wrongful eviction occurred. If it happened in Alaska, then Alaska courts would likely have jurisdiction. If it happened in Missouri, then Missouri courts would be appropriate.

2. **Venue**: The venue for the lawsuit should be determined based on where the property is located and where the events leading to the lawsuit took place.

3. **Applicable Laws**:
   - **Alaska Law**: If the eviction occurred in Alaska, Alaska's landlord-tenant laws would apply.
   - **Missouri Law**: If the eviction occurred in Missouri, Missouri's landlord-tenant laws would apply.

4. **Statute of Limitations**: Both states have different statutes of limitations for wrongful eviction claims. It is important to check the specific time limits within which Ava must file her lawsuit.

5. **Damages**: The amount of $61,000 in damages will be considered by the court, and evidence supporting this claim will need to be presented.

Given these considerations, here are some steps Ava should take:

- **Consult a Lawyer**: Ava should consult with an attorney who is familiar with landlord-tenant laws in either Alaska or Missouri, depending on where the eviction occurred.
- **Gather Evidence**: Collect all relevant documents and evidence that support her claim of wrongful eviction.
- **File the Lawsuit**: File the lawsuit in the appropriate court within the statute of limitations period.
