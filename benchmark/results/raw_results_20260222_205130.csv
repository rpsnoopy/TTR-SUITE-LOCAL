Ava is from Alaska. Mia is from Missouri. Ava sues Mia for wrongful eviction for $61,000.

Answer:","# Diversity Jurisdiction Analysis

## Requirements for Diversity Jurisdiction (28 U.S.C. § 1332)

1. **Complete Diversity of Citizenship** between the parties
2. **Amount in Controversy** exceeds **$75,000** (exclusive of interest and costs)

---

## Analysis

### 1. Complete Diversity
- **Ava** → Alaska citizen
- **Mia** → Missouri citizen
- ✅ **Diversity is satisfied** — the parties are citizens of different states

### 2. Amount in Controversy
- Ava's claim = **$61,000**
- The requirement is that the amount **exceed $75,000**
- ❌ **$61,000 does NOT exceed $75,000**

---

## Conclusion

**Federal diversity jurisdiction does NOT exist** in this case.

Although complete diversity is present, the amount in controversy fails to satisfy the statutory threshold — it falls **$14,000 short** of the required amount. A federal court would therefore **lack subject matter jurisdiction**, and the case could **not be heard in federal court** on diversity grounds.

Isabella is from Alaska. Elijah is from Montana. Isabella sues Elijah for patent infringement for $1,522,000.

Answer:","# Federal Court Jurisdiction Analysis

## Applicable Jurisdictional Bases

### 1. Federal Question Jurisdiction (28 U.S.C. § 1331)
Patent infringement claims **arise under federal law** (35 U.S.C. § 271), giving federal district courts **federal question jurisdiction** regardless of any other factors.

### 2. Diversity Jurisdiction (28 U.S.C. § 1332)
Even setting aside federal question jurisdiction, diversity jurisdiction is also satisfied:

| Element | Requirement | Facts |
|---|---|---|
| **Citizenship of Plaintiff** | Diverse from Defendant | Isabella – **Alaska** |
| **Citizenship of Defendant** | Diverse from Plaintiff | Elijah – **Montana** |
| **Complete Diversity** | No shared state citizenship | ✅ Satisfied |
| **Amount in Controversy** | Exceeds **$75,000** | $1,522,000 ✅ |

## Conclusion

Federal courts have jurisdiction under **both** grounds:
- ✅ **Federal Question** (patent law is exclusively federal)
- ✅ **Diversity of Citizenship** (AK vs. MT; $1,522,000 > $75,000)

1. the purchaser expressly agrees to be held liable (express agreement)

2. the assets are fraudulently conveyed to the purchaser in order to avoid liability (fraudulent conveyance)

3. there is a de facto merger between the purchaser and seller (de facto merger)

4. the purchaser is a mere continuation of the seller (mere continuation)

For the following fact patterns, determine which exceptions apply.

<example>
Facts: Big Chemical Corp purchased substantially all of Small Chemical Corp's assets three years ago. The purchase agreement included a provision that Big Chemical would assume Small Chemical's liabilities only to the extent necessary to continue its operations. Following the asset purhcase, Small Chemical's directors assumed directorships on Big Chemical's board. Residents of a town where Small Chemical had a factory now bring suit against Big Chemical for harm that occured several years prior to the asset purchase.
Exceptions: de facto merger, mere continuation
</example>

<example>
Facts: Home Builders III purchased substantially all of Home Builders II's assets. The purchase agreement contained no provision for assumption of any liabilities. Home Builders II had built several thousand defective homes. Home Builders III was made aware of this fact during negotiations even though no claims had been brought against Home Builders II at the time. Following the asset sale, Home Builders III maintained the same offices, employees, and management.  Customers of Home Builders II bring suit against Home Builders III several years later after they discover defects in their homes.

The purchase agreement explicitly provides for the assumption of **all** of Special Corp's liabilities, which directly satisfies the express agreement exception.

Facts: Big Chemical Corp purchased substantially all of Small Chemical Corp's assets three years ago. The purchase agreement included a provision that Big Chemical would assume Small Chemical's liabilities only to the extent necessary to continue its operations. Following the asset purhcase, Small Chemical's directors assumed directorships on Big Chemical's board. Residents of a town where Small Chemical had a factory now bring suit against Big Chemical for harm that occured several years prior to the asset purchase.

Facts: Home Builders III purchased substantially all of Home Builders II's assets. The purchase agreement contained no provision for assumption of any liabilities. Home Builders II had built several thousand defective homes. Home Builders III was made aware of this fact during negotiations even though no claims had been brought against Home Builders II at the time. Following the asset sale, Home Builders III maintained the same offices, employees, and management.  Customers of Home Builders II bring suit against Home Builders III several years later after they discover defects in their homes.

Facts: Mediocre Corp purchased all of Special Corp's assets. The purchase agreement provides for assumption of all of Special Corp's liabilities. Following","Based on the facts provided, the applicable exceptions are:

**De Facto Merger** and **Mere Continuation**

**De Facto Merger**: Although this was structured as an asset purchase rather than a formal merger, the transaction has the hallmarks of a de facto merger. Big Chemical purchased *substantially all* of Small Chemical's assets, and Small Chemical's directors assumed directorships on Big Chemical's board, indicating a continuity of ownership and management structure characteristic of a merger.

**Mere Continuation**: The facts support this exception as well. The overlap in directors between Small Chemical and Big Chemical — with Small Chemical's directors moving to Big Chemical's board following the transaction — suggests that Big Chemical is essentially a continuation of Small Chemical under a different name, with the same leadership carrying on the same enterprise.

**Notes on inapplicable exceptions**:
- **Express Agreement** does not apply because the purchase agreement *limited* assumption of liabilities to those necessary to continue operations, rather than broadly assuming all liabilities.
- **Fraudulent Conveyance** does not appear to apply as there are no facts suggesting the asset purchase was structured to fraudulently avoid liability.","de facto merger,mere continuation",True,4890,252,51.53,0

Text: the texas code does not define election laws, and we have found no case construing this phrase. thus, we first look to the ordinary, contemporary, common meaning of election laws. see perrin v. united states, 444 u.s. 37, 42, 100 s.ct. 311, 314, 62 l.ed.2d 199 (1979) (noting that it is a fundamental canon of statutory construction ... that, unless otherwise defined, words will be interpreted as taking their ordinary, contemporary, common meaning). we think that the common meaning of election laws is laws that specifically govern elections, rather than generally applicable laws that may affect elections. if the texas legislature wanted 31.003 to cover the latter, we doubt that it would have inserted the adjectival modifier election directly before the noun law. by forming an open compound phrase such as election law, the texas legislature meant a combination of separate words that are so closely related as to constitute a single concept. chicago manual of style 6.33 (14th rev. ed. 1993). an election district, for instance, is not a district devised for many functions, including elections; it is a district created for the purposes of elections. 5 oxford english dictionary 116 (2d ed. 1989). moreover, an election board is not an agency that carries out all the responsibilities of a municipality, including elections; it is an agency charged with the conduct of elections. blacks law dictionary 519 (6th ed.1990).
